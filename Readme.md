# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a scalable IMDb movie recommendation system using a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering (ALS) and content-based filtering (TF-IDF and cosine similarity). It analyzes user interactions and movie metadata to provide real-time, personalized movie suggestions. Powered by PySpark, the system is optimized for large datasets and seamless updates.
